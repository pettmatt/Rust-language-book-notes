# Comparing Performance: Loops vs. Iterators

Interesting chapter to say least. The chapter offered a great example how much faster iterators can be compared to loops and how high-level ideas translate to low-level code. Without diving deeper, that was the chapter. Great read and if a person has deeper understanding in low-level code they can get more out of this chapter than what I was able to.
