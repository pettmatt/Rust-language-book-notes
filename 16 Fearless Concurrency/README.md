# Fearless Concurrency

Here are the topics we’ll cover in this chapter:

- How to create threads to run multiple pieces of code at the same time
- Message-passing concurrency, where channels send messages between threads
- Shared-state concurrency, where multiple threads have access to some piece of data
- The Sync and Send traits, which extend Rust’s concurrency guarantees to user-defined types as well as types provided by the standard library
