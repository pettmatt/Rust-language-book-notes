# Introduction

This repository contains excerices and notes that I did to get better grasp how Rust works. Some of these excercises are from "The Rust Programming Language" book.

I have named my own excercises little bit differently so those would be easier to spot. The naming scheme used is `x.x.5` whenever I have done excercise that doesn't come from the book.

*This is my way of learning Rust so there will be some experiments I do to test how similar this enviroment is to my usual JavaScript environment.*

As they say... *Let's have fun hackin*
