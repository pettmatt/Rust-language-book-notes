# Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes

Rust includes specific ways of handling basic concepts of programming, for example `generic types` can be seen in function parameters, they don't necessary contain any values, but they include the base for Rust to do necessary computing to compile the application without a problem.

## Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function

Example is included in the Rust file, but this part doesn't really include anything unique to Rust language, just good practices in programming. If you are going to need a code multiple times you should probably turn it into a function. This way your code is easier to maintain and to read.
