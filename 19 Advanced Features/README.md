# Advanced Features

And now we should be ready to explore more advanced features of Rust or edge cases that may occur time to time.

The chapter will contain following topics:

- **Unsafe Rust:** how to opt out of some of Rustâ€™s guarantees and take responsibility for manually upholding those guarantees
- **Advanced traits:** associated types, default type parameters, fully qualified syntax, supertraits, and the newtype pattern in relation to traits
- **Advanced types:** more about the newtype pattern, type aliases, the never type, and dynamically sized types
Advanced functions and closures: function pointers and returning closures
- **Macros:** ways to define code that defines more code at compile time
