# Advanced Features

And now we should be ready to explore more advanced features of Rust or edge cases that may occur time to time.

The chapter will contain following topics:

- **Unsafe Rust:** how to opt out of some of Rust’s guarantees and take responsibility for manually upholding those guarantees
- **Advanced traits:** associated types, default type parameters, fully qualified syntax, supertraits, and the newtype pattern in relation to traits
- **Advanced types:** more about the newtype pattern, type aliases, the never type, and dynamically sized types
Advanced functions and closures: function pointers and returning closures
- **Macros:** ways to define code that defines more code at compile time

*During this chapter I'm going to test the code in [Rust-lang playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021). So just like the last chapter, this chapter won't include any rust files.*
