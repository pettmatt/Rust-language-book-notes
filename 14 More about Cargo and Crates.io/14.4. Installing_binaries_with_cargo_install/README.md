# Installing Binaries with cargo install

If a package has a binary target developers can install them through `cargo install` command. Reminder what the binary target means: **A binary target is the runnable program that is created if the crate has a src/main.rs file or another file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isn’t runnable on its own but is suitable for including within other programs. Usually, crates have information in the README file about whether a crate is a library, has a binary target, or both.**

**All binaries installed with `cargo install` are stored in the installation root’s bin folder. If you installed Rust using `rustup.rs` and don’t have any custom configurations, this directory will be `$HOME/.cargo/bin`. Ensure that directory is in your `$PATH` to be able to run programs you’ve installed with `cargo install`.**
